        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>My name is Holden Garrison. I am from Jacksonville, Florida. I have recently begun my journey to become a web developer with the help of the UCF coding bootcamp. I am also currently a student at Arizona State University in the  online software engineering program. While CSS and HTML are new two me I do have experience in Java and C++ through my coursework at ASU, as well as some experience in Javascript through self study.
            </p>
            <p> My previous work experience was in the United States Navy, where I served as a nuclear machinist mate on submarines. I was a member of Reactor Laboratories division, where my responsibilities included maintaining reactor plant and steam plant water chemistry as well as collecting and monitoring radiological data and maintaining appropriate radiological controls. I attended training at Navy Nuclear Training Command in Charleston, SC from 2012-2013 and at NPTU Ballston Spa in Ballston Spa, NY from 2013-2015. After completing training I served on the USS Georgia from 2015-2019 and  then as an instructor at NPTU Charleston from 2019-2022.
